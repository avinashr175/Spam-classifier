Title: The Efficiency of Summer Paddy Cultivation in BTAD Region of Assam: A Non-Parametric Approach



Abstract: Normally, the summer rice in India was cultivated in water-logged low-lying areas during November to May to utilize residual water in the soil. It was cultivated in river basin deltas where water accumulated during monsoon and could not be drained out in the winter months. But, with the arrival of many high yielding varieties of paddy, most of which are of short maturity duration, and with the spread of minor irrigation, the summer paddy is now cultivated almost in all types of soil and land height wherever irrigation water is available. In Assam, paddy is cultivated in three seasons - autumn, winter, and summer. In terms of acreage and production, winter rice has traditionally been the most dominant, followed by autumn paddy. However, in recent decade, the acreage and output shares of winter and autumn rice together in total rice area have been declining continuously while the importance of summer rice has been increasing in term of acreage allocation and yield. This trend has led to discussions among academicians and policy makers on several issues including the efficiency aspect. Under this background, the present study has examined the technical, allocative, cost and scale efficiencies of paddy cultivation during summer vis-Ã -vis winter and autumn seasons in Assam. The study applied the non-parametric method of Data Envelopment Analysis. It also examines various factors influencing the summer paddy cultivation and constraints faced by sample farmers, and then it suggests policy measures/strategies for sustainable summer paddy cultivation. The study is based mainly on the primary survey data collected from the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts region of Assam.
